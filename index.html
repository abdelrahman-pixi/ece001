    <p><font face="Times New Roman"size="5">The <b>COVID-19</b> pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern regarding COVID-19 on 30 January 2020, and later declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020. As of 4 June 2021, more than 172 million cases have been confirmed, with more than 3.7 million confirmed deaths attributed to COVID-19, making it one of the deadliest pandemics in history.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"size="5">The <b>COVID-19</b> pandemic has affected many science, space and technology institutions and government agencies worldwide, leading to reduced productivity on a number of fields and programs. It has also opened several new funding research lines in several governmental agencies around the world</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman"size="5"> <b></b>Computer simulations are being used extensively in the fight against COVID-19. In particular, they are being used to predict how the virus may spread (both geographically and temporally) amongst populations of people and how different interventions may affect how the disease spreads.</b></font></p>
   
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"size="6"><b>Planning and tracking.</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"size="5">Big data and artificial intelligence (AI) have helped facilitate COVID-19 preparedness and the tracking of people, and so the spread of infection, in several countries. Tools such as migration maps, which use mobile phones, mobile payment applications, and social media to collect real-time data on the location of people, allowed Chinese authorities to track the movement of people who had visited the Wuhan market, the pandemic's epicentre.5, 6 With these data, machine learning models were developed to forecast the regional transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and guide border checks and surveillance.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"size="5">As soon as China reported the outbreak, Taiwan initiated health checks for airline travellers from Wuhan, integrating data from immigration records with its centralised, real-time national health insurance database.8 This integration allowed health-care facilities to access patients' travel histories and identify individuals for SARS-CoV-2 testing and tracking.8 Taiwan's proximity to Wuhan, China, made the region particularly susceptible to COVID-19, but its efficient use of big data is credited for the low number of cases and deaths.</font></p>
     
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"size="6"><b>Screening for infection</b></font></p> 
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"size="5">China uses free, web-based and cloud-based tools to screen and direct individuals to appropriate resources.7 High-performance infrared thermal cameras set up in Taiwanese airports are used to capture thermal images of people in real time, rapidly detecting individuals with a fever.8 In Singapore, people have their temperature measured at the entries of workplaces, schools, and public transport. The data from the thermometers is tracked and used to identify emerging hot spots and clusters of infection where testing could be initiated.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"size="5">Unlike most other countries, Iceland has launched widespread testing of asymptomatic individuals.16 Using mobile technology, Iceland collects data on patient-reported symptoms and combines these data with other datasets such as clinical and genomic sequencing data to reveal information about the pathology and spread of the virus.16 This approach has added to the knowledge base regarding the prevalence and transmission of asymptomatic COVID-19. To date, Iceland has had the highest per-capita testing rate and among the lowest per-capita COVID-19 mortality rate.16 Other countries offering widespread testing include Germany and South Korea.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"size="5">In the USA, a private company has used digital thermometers to collect real-time data on clusters of febrile illness,19 and a national study is capturing resting heart rate with a smartwatch application, which could be able to identify COVID-19 emerging outbreaks.20 These initiatives are either enterprise-driven or investigational and are not integrated into policy and practice.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman"size="6"><b>Contact tracing</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"size="5">South Korea has implemented tools for aggressive contact tracing, using security camera footage, facial recognition technology, bank card records, and global positioning system (GPS) data from vehicles and mobile phones to provide real-time data and detailed timelines of people's travel.18 South Koreans receive emergency text alerts about new COVID-19 cases in their region, and people who could have been in contact with infected individuals are instructed to report to testing centres and self-isolate.14 By identifying and isolating infections early, South Korea has maintained among the lowest per-capita mortality rates in the world.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"size="5">Germany has launched a smartwatch application that collects pulse, temperature, and sleep pattern data to screen for signs of viral illness.17 Data from the application are presented on an online, interactive map in which authorities can assess the likelihood of COVID-19 incidence across the nation.17 With widespread testing and digital health interventions, Germany has maintained a low per-capita mortality rate, relative to other countries, despite a high prevalence of cases.</font></p>
    
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"size="6"><b>Quarantine and self-isolation</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"size="5">The indiscriminate lockdowns for infection control in several countries have had severe socioeconomic consequences. With digital technology, quarantine can be implemented in individuals who have been exposed to or infected with the virus, with less strict restrictions imposed on other citizens. China's quick response (QR) code system, in which individuals are required to fill out a symptom survey and record their temperature, allows authorities to monitor health and control movement.7 The QR code serves as a COVID-19 health status certificate and travel pass, with colour codes representing low, medium, and high risk; individuals with green codes are permitted to travel unrestricted, whereas individuals with red codes are required to self-isolate for 14 days. China also uses AI-powered surveillance cameras, drone-borne cameras, and portable digital recorders to monitor and restrict the gathering of people in public.</font></p>
    
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"size="6"><b>Clinical management</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"size="5">AI can facilitate rapid diagnosis and risk prediction of COVID-19. A cloud-based AI-assisted CT service is used to detect COVID-19 pneumonia cases in China.7 This technology processes CT images in seconds, differentiating COVID-19 from other lung diseases and speeding up the diagnostic process substantially.7, 11 COVID-Net, an open-source deep convolutional neural network design available to clinicians across the globe, can quickly detect COVID-19 cases from other lung diseases on chest x-rays.28 Machine learning algorithms developed in China can predict the likelihood of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome and critical illness among infected patients.7, 28 These prediction models can guide clinical decision-making and resource allocation, identifying regions and hospitals in need of critical care resources and medical supplies.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"size="5">Virtual care platforms, using video conferencing and digital monitoring, have been used worldwide to deliver remote health care to patients as a means of reducing their exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in health-care institutions. In Canada, clinician-to-patient video visits have increased from approximately 1000 visits per day in February, 2020, to 14â€ˆ000 per day by mid-May.29 Countries such as the USA and Australia have also harnessed digital technology to provide remote care to patients with chronic conditions or with mild or moderate COVID-19 illness in their homes.30, 31 If implemented and delivered appropriately, virtual care can increase health-care access during the pandemic and after, but possible risks could include misdiagnoses, equipment malfunction, privacy breaches, and costs to the health-care system.</font></p>
